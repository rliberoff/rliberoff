# Hi there! I'm Rodrigo Liberoff 👋🏻👨🏻‍💻

I'm a Computer Engineer professional with more than 20 years of hands-on experience. I'm passionate with the design, conceptualization and development of software systems and applications — mainly with the C# programming language — creating the best software architectures and researching new technologies and their positive impact on clients and companies, focusing mainly on Microsoft technologies, specially the .NET platform (currently with .NET 6, 7 and 8) and using Agile Methodologies (like Scrum, SAFe).
